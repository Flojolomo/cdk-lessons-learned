# CDK Lessons Learned

As an CDK advocate, I want to make mylife and the life of other CDK developers easier by documenting challenges I faced, the (root) causes and possible ways to work around.

As a never ending story and considering the live long learning curve when using state of the art technologies, there will pop up new modules from time to time. So stay tuned to not miss any updates.

| Module name                                                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| [Stack Dependency Lambda Layer](./stack-dependency-lambda-layer/) | CDK allows to share resources between stacks & nested stacks. This project demonstrates cases, one where those updates break the deployment and others that succeed sharing resource references over stack boundaries |
